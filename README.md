# Learning SvelteKit with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) app that I've built to learn and experiment with SvelteKit, a modern framework for building web applications, and to incorporate the styling power of Tailwind CSS with the convenience of DaisyUI.

## Overview

- **SvelteKit**: SvelteKit is a next-generation framework for building web applications. It's designed to be simple, efficient, and highly modular. With SvelteKit, you can create reactive and component-based applications with ease.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to quickly design and style your web applications using pre-defined classes. It promotes rapid development and consistency in design.

- **DaisyUI**: DaisyUI is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that provides a set of additional utility classes, components, and themes, further enhancing the power of Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- A simple web app built using SvelteKit (Doctor app).
- Styling with Tailwind CSS and extended with DaisyUI classes.
- A practical example of how SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI can be combined in a project.
